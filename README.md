# Weflat

Repository of the retired https://www.weflat.fr/ web application, that used to connect buyers of real estate with architects.

It features:
 - PostgreSQL 16 database
 - Java Spring Boot 3.2 stateless backend (signed session token)
 - Angular 17 frontend (PWA in french language and server-side rendered)
 - Apache 2.4 reverse proxy
 - Kubernetes deployment mode
 
It uses Stripe as payment service, and GMail as mail provider (for user notifications).

Feel free to do whatever you want with this!
