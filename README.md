# Weflat

Repository of the retired https://www.weflat.fr/ web application, that used to connect buyers of real estate with architects.

It is composed of a PostgreSQL database, a Java Spring Boot backend, an Angular frontend (in french language, server-side rendered, and PWA), and an Apache reverse proxy.
It is deployable as Docker Compose.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this!
